## Introduction
Musicians playing instruments with a reed spend a lot of time obsessing over which reed to play for the next concert. Players of Clarinet, Saxophone, Oboe and Basson all share a common challenge of finding a reed that will suite the accoustic, the repertoire, individual preferences and level of playing. Most players keep a number of reeds of different characteristics in order to have something available for every occasion, which means a number of reeds laying around in boxes and cases.

| --------- | ---------|

# User experience 
## Design choices, guiding principles
- **Recognition.** One common header and footer is applied for all pages across the site. 
- **Responsiveness.** The content is designed to be accessible equally well on a mobile client as on a full size screen.
- **Clarity.** Headlines, texts and organization shall be short and to the point, to guide and avoid overwhelming the user. 
- **Just enough.** information. In each view, there is enough information to maintain an overview to decide on the next action. Only in the detail-pages is the complete set of information shared. 

## Fonts
- The set of fonts was chosen for a modern and crisp look on the Website. Montserrat and Roboto are both appreciated as being clear and easy to read. Elegant yet professional.  
<img src="static/images/Fonts.png" alt="Selected fonts" width="400"/> 

## Color schemes
- The colorscheme was selected with the basic color of cane and wood in mind. The slightly beige and yellow tones combined with some matching colors were chosen to give a clean yet stylish impression.
