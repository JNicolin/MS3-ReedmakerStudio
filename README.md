## Introduction

For reed players â€” oboists, bassoonists, clarinetists, saxophonists â€” the quest for the perfect reed never ends. Each rehearsal, venue, or piece calls for something slightly different. We craft, tweak, and rotate reeds constantly. But too often, those hard-earned insights get lost in a drawer.

ðŸŽ¯ **The challenge:** How do we learn from our own reedmaking â€” and each other's?

---

## Enter Reedmaker Studio

Reedmaker Studio is a shared space for documenting, reflecting on, and discussing reedmaking. 

- **Log your reeds** with cane source, dimensions, tone, usage, and repertoire.
- **Connect with others** by commenting and exchanging experiences.
- **Publish posts** about your methods, findings, or frustrations.
- **Discover trends** in your reeds â€” and in the community.

Reedmaker Studio is built for musicians who want to go beyond trial-and-error, together.

**Document your work. Share your journey. Learn with others.**

# Purpose and goals
## App owner goals

- **Accelerate reedmaking skills among musicians**  
  Provide tools that help players learn faster by documenting, comparing, and reflecting on their reeds.

- **Build a dedicated community**  
  Attract reed players (oboists, bassoonists, clarinetists) to share experiences and support each other.

- **Enable knowledge sharing**  
  Make it easy to publish blog posts and comments, so practical insights spread within the community.

- **Lay the groundwork for targeted resources**  
  Create a user base that can benefit from future materials like tutorials, guides, or curated content tailored to reedmakers.

## User goals

- **Document reeds with precision**  
  Keep a searchable archive of each reedâ€™s build, feel, and use in performance.

- **Identify patterns and preferences**  
  Spot trends over time to improve material choice, shaping, and scraping technique.

- **Engage with fellow reedmakers**  
  Share insights through blog posts and comments. Learn from othersâ€™ successes and struggles.

- **Improve musical consistency**  
  Use your reed history to support better playing, rehearsal prep, and concert readiness.

# User experience 
## Design choices, guiding principles
- **Recognition.** One common header and footer is applied for all pages across the site. 
- **Responsiveness.** The content is designed to be accessible equally well on a mobile client as on a full size screen.
- **Clarity.** Headlines, texts and organization shall be short and to the point, to guide and avoid overwhelming the user. 
- **Just enough.** information. In each view, there is enough information to maintain an overview to decide on the next action. Only in the detail-pages is the complete set of information shared. 

## Fonts
- The set of fonts was chosen for a modern and crisp look on the Website. Montserrat and Roboto are both appreciated as being clear and easy to read. Elegant yet professional.

## Static validation of code
### CSS, HTML and JavaScript validation
 - All CSS was validated in the W3 group validator: No remaining comments or errors
 - All HTML vwas validate in W3 group validator: The HTML validator does not like DTL tags. It does give warnings for this. These are the only remaining.
 - The JavaScript was run through the CI Linter app: No remaining errors

## Testing for responsiveness
- Cross-browser testing was done to validate the responsiveness of the application accross different screensizes and positions. Chrome Inspect and the dedicated ResponsivelyApp were used. 

There are no known remaining issues from this testing.

## Automated testing
- The application was tested using Chrome Lighthouse for Good practices, Performance and Accessibility.

## Test of deploy to production environment in Heruko
###
Steps to deploy this application to heruko
  1. **Sign in to Heroku**
  2. **Connect to repository on GitHub** <br>
Under the Deploy tab, find Deployment method â†’ GitHub and search the correct repo (.../MS3-ReedmakerStudio).

  3. **ReedStudio expects these config variables**<br>
Go to the Settings tab â†’ Reveal Config Vars, and add:
    ```
    DATABASE_URL='your PostgreSQL db url'
    DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=0
    DJANGO_ENV=production # ensures correct settings file is used
    SECRET_KEY='a secret key of your choice'
    ```
  4. **Push manual deploy from main branch** 

    Result: Deploy works with no errors:<br><br>

# Known issues and Future features
## Known issues
- Functional testing has been performed along the development. A number of discoveries were made among which all revealed errors have been corrected in the deployed version.
- There are no remaining errors or bugs, with the exception of the mentioned warnings from the HTML validator on Django Template Language tags.
- I have spent quite some time on figuring out how to build a modular way of commenting. As I wanted to implement commenting feature for Reeds as well as for Blogposts, I wanted to learn how to develop this once and use it twice. I came to learn about the generic views from the Django framework, and that was the way to do it!

## Future features
###
I keep a list of feature cards in my [GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/users/JNicolin/projects/8). Future features are labelled as **Enhancement** in the board. Below is an extract of Ideas at the time of writing this text:

- [Upload photos of reeds direct from a mobile camera](https://github.com/JNicolin/MS3-ReedmakerStudio/issues/42)
- [Dynamically adjust the experience of the application, based on the user's type of instrumenty](https://github.com/JNicolin/MS3-ReedmakerStudio/issues/43)
- [Reach out to community members with a request for help](https://github.com/JNicolin/MS3-ReedmakerStudio/issues/44)
- [Send notices to registered members at addition of blog posts](https://github.com/JNicolin/MS3-ReedmakerStudio/issues/45)
