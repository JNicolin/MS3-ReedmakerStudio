# My reed story

Musicians playing instruments with a reed spend a lot of time obsessing over which reed to play for the next concert. Players of Clarinet, Saxophone, Oboe and Basson all share a common challenge of finding a reed that will suite the accoustic, the repertoire, individual preferences and level of playing. Most players keep a number of reeds of different characteristics in order to have something available for every occasion, which means a number of reeds laying around in boxes and cases. A common challenge is to recall which reed has what characteristics, thus will be the perfect fit for an upcoming concert.
